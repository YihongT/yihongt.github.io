  <p>
    I'm a doctoral student at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">McGill University</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://lijunsun.github.io/" target="_blank">Lijun Sun</a>. 
    Before joining McGill, I obtained my M.Phil. in Urban Analytics and Smart Cities from <a href="https://www.hku.hk/" target="_blank">The University of Hong Kong</a> and my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from <a href="https://ois.bupt.edu.cn/About_Us.htm" target="_blank">BUPT</a>. 
    I have also held research positions at institutions including <a href="http://polyu-mobility-ai-lab.com/" target="_blank">Mobility AI Lab</a> at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (<a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">HK PolyU</a>), <a href="https://mobility.mit.edu/" target="_blank">JTL Transit Lab</a> at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (<a href="https://www.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a>), and <a href="https://dajiangsuo.github.io/" target="_blank">Suo Lab</a> at Arizona State University (<a href="https://www.asu.edu/" target="_blank">ASU</a>).
  <p>
    My research focuses on innovating data-driven, statistical, and AI methods to develop more connected, autonomous, intelligent, and human-centered urban and transportation systems, and to uncover the social dynamics they embody. 
    My primary research interests span four interrelated areas: 
    <span style="display:inline-block; width:0.5em; height:0.5em; border-radius:50%; background:#ffb05b; margin-right:0.1em;"></span><strong>
    Human-centered Modeling and Synthesis</strong>, focusing on population and mobility data with equity, privacy, and intent-awareness; 
    <span style="display:inline-block; width:0.5em; height:0.5em; border-radius:50%; background:#41A0FF; margin-right:0.1em;"></span><strong>
    Large Language Models for Urban Science</strong>, aiming to build self-evolving agents for urban scientific discovery, planning, and causal reasoning; 
    <span style="display:inline-block; width:0.5em; height:0.5em; border-radius:50%; background:#E91E63; margin-right:0.1em;"></span><strong>
    Multimodal Transportation Systems</strong>, using multi-source data fusion to understand and optimize mobility systems; and 
    <span style="display:inline-block; width:0.5em; height:0.5em; border-radius:50%; background:#4CAF50; margin-right:0.1em;"></span><strong>
    Spatiotemporal Data Modeling</strong>, developing models for forecasting, control, and behavior inference across space and time.
  <p>
    <i class="fa-solid fa-rectangle-ad" style="color: #d60000;"></i> <span style="color: #d60000;">I am looking for collaborators and interns</span> with the goal of conducting impactful research and publishing in top AI conferences and leading urban and transportation journals.

#     A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicolor_cat" target="_blank">bicolor cat</a> is a cat with white fur combined with fur of some other colour, for example solid black, tabby, or colourpointed.
#   </p>
#   <p>
#     There are various patterns of a bicolour cat. These range from the Van-patterned (colour on the crown of the head 
#     and the tail only) to a solid colour with a throat locket or medallion. Bicolour coats are found in many cat breeds, 
#     as well as being common in domestic longhair and domestic shorthair cats.
