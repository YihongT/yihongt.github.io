    I'm an interdisciplinary researcher interested in applying data-driven, statistical, and AI methods to build more connected, autonomous, intelligent, and user-centered urban and transportation systems for broad social good.

    supported by the HKU <a href="https://gradsch.hku.hk/prospective_students/fees_scholarships_and_financial_support/postgraduate_scholarships" target="_blank">Postgraduate Scholarship</a> 
    and advised by <a href="https://zhanzhaowf.github.io/" target="_blank">Zhan Zhao</a>. 
    Before joining HKU, I worked as a full-time research assistant at <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://polyu-mobility-ai-lab.com/" target="_blank">Wei Ma</a>.

  <p>
    I've just completed my summer research internship at <a href="https://www.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a>, working with <a href="https://zhuangdingyi.github.io/" target="_blank">Dingyi Zhuang</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/people/jinhua-zhao" target="_blank">Jinhua Zhao</a>, <a href="https://dcp.ufl.edu/urp/people_wang_s/" target="_blank">Shenhao Wang</a>, and <a href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/koutsopoulos-haris/" target="_blank">Haris N.

#     A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicolor_cat" target="_blank">bicolor cat</a> is a cat with white fur combined with fur of some other colour, for example solid black, tabby, or colourpointed.
#   </p>
#   <p>
#     There are various patterns of a bicolour cat. These range from the Van-patterned (colour on the crown of the head 
#     and the tail only) to a solid colour with a throat locket or medallion. Bicolour coats are found in many cat breeds, 
#     as well as being common in domestic longhair and domestic shorthair cats.
